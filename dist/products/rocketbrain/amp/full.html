  <p>When I was a young boy, I can remember wowing all of my friends with random facts that I had memorized. I&rsquo;m not sure why, but I always was able to learn things faster than others my age.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">I spent my entire career as a professor at The University of Columbia and I loved every single part of it.</span></strong></p>
<p>I felt like I was doing exactly what I was called to do. The only thing I loved more than learning was teaching, and who better to teach than the young adults who are about to enter the so called &ldquo;real world&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>I lived about 30 minutes away from our campus with my wife Elise. I honestly can say that I had the life I had always dreamed of. Well&hellip; almost</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, my wife and I never had a child. We tried and tried but she never was able to get pregnant.</span></p>
<p>Although this was sad at the time for us two we stayed hopeful that we would eventually get our miracle baby.</span></p>
<p>Many years went by with no luck. We even looked at adopting a child but we never seemed to be able to find the right one.</span></p>
<p>We began to accept and come to terms with the fact that maybe our family was fine the way it is. With just us two.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">My wife and I were both in our mid 40s and we decided that maybe it was time to stop trying.</span></strong></p>
<p>Although we were sad for a while, we eventually came to terms with it.</span></p>
<p>Then one day as I walked into our home I found my wife sitting on the couch. She looked so incredibly happy but she had tears coming from her eyes.</span></p>
<p>I rushed to the couch to comfort her and see what the problem was.<strong> That&rsquo;s when she let out a massive smile and gave me a huge hug.</strong></span></p>
<p>I was still confused but I gave her a hug back. As she was crying in my arms, I looked at our coffee table and saw what appeared to be a used pregnancy test in a zip lock baggie.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">I looked a little closer and saw a positive result.</span></strong></p>
<p>So many emotions were coming out of me at the same time. It was a feeling I will never be able to put into words.</span></p>
<p>We finally were blessed with our miracle baby.</span></p>
<p>We had saved money our entire adult lives anticipating this moment and it finally came.</span></p>
<p>On top of that, I was planning on retiring soon. So I was going to have unlimited time to raise our child.</span></p>
<p>9 months later I welcomed our handsome son into the world and said goodbye to my wife forever.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, she passed away giving birth to our son. So I solely held the responsibility to raise our miracle baby. I made a promise to my late wife and a promise to myself that I would do everything in my power to ensure this child would live a great life.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">Tommy coming into the world was such a blessing.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.shgcdn.com/30ae150c-018c-4c18-a1e6-e0eec62e934f/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/" alt="" /></span></strong></p>
<p>When he was younger he grew up just like any other kid.</span></p>
<p>But I noticed the older he grew, the more distant he became.</span></p>
<p>I thought for a second it was normal thing that teenage boys go through. But then I asked him about it.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey champ, can I talk to you for a second&rdquo; I said</span></p>
<p>I asked him why he never wanted a ride from me anymore. He always was getting rides from his friends parents.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I can drop you and your friends off to practice if you need Tommy Boy&rdquo; I would say.</span></p>
<p>He almost always declined.</span></p>
<p>And then one day he finally took me up on it. <strong>He asked if I could take him and a couple of his friends to the movies.</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes I quickly said!</span></p>
<p>We hopped in my car and hit the road to go get both of his friends.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, what should have been a 30 minute drive turned into over an hour trip.</span></p>
<p>I swear I was following the directions, but the stupid GPS kept on rerouting itself. The kids were completely silent and Tommy was giving me a glare.</span></p>
<p>I felt bad for getting my son to the movies late but it was an honest mistake. I&rsquo;m just not the best at using technology.</span></p>
<p>I knew that I was expected to be back at the movies to pick him up in just an hour, so I sat down in the living room to watch some tv and kill some time.</span></p>
<p>Next thing I know, I&rsquo;m being woken up by Tommy. I must had fell asleep.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get home son&rdquo;? I said in a concerning tone</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We waited for an hour dad.. Michaels dad ended up picking us up&rdquo; He replied with a disappointed tone as he walked down the hallway to his room.</span></p>
<p>That night, I had to do some serious thinking. It was clear that I was getting older and I felt bad because I couldn&rsquo;t be the father that I wanted to be for Tommy.</span></p>
<p>Growing up as a single child, without a mother and an older father can&rsquo;t be easy. <strong>I felt like he was getting robbed of a normal childhood in every way. I had to do something about it.</strong></span></p>
<p>I spent that night thinking back to the old days when my mind was sharp as a tack. That was a part of me that my child never got to meet. I knew there had to be something that I could do.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">I got on our computer and started doing research on how to keep a sharp brain.</span></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.shgcdn.com/965c743e-4f46-43d1-9a95-213897a40f7d/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>The only things I found were things that I already knew. <strong>Exercise, sleep and diet.</strong></span></p>
<p>But there had to be something else. There had to be some sort of way to achieve greater mental clarity.</span></p>
<p>After a couple more hours of research I finally stumbled upon something that looked interesting.</span></p>
<p>They were called <a href="https://nutrapod.co/products/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></span></a>. These pods were a coffee alternative that claim to be much better for you. hey</span></p>
<p>The reviews said they were like <strong>vitamins for your brain</strong> and their website promised to help you achieve <strong>higher levels of mental clarity</strong>.</span></p>
<p>I also read about the ingredients online and was really impressed. Theres MCT Oil, Turmeric, Lion's Mane, and B-Vitamins&nbsp; all packed in just one blend (Rocket Brain).</span></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.shgcdn.com/bbd45021-15b2-4bf4-8349-c1563cfde3af/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>Apparently <strong>MCT Oil</strong> has been shown to improve short term cognition and reduce appetite.</span></p>
<p>And <strong>Turmeric</strong> increases memory functions and boosts&nbsp; something called "Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor" (BDNF), so that your brain continues to create new brain cells&mdash;something which naturally stops at 25 without the help of BDNF.</span></p>
<p><strong>Lion&rsquo;s Mane</strong> has been shown to reduce symptoms of memory loss, prevent neuronal damage accumulated during Alzheimer&rsquo;s, decrease cognitive impairment in adults, and reduce inflammation in the brain.</span></p>
<p>And last but not least <strong>B Vitamins</strong> give the brain and body tan extra energy boost.</span></p>
<p>Desperate for something, I put in my credit card information and ordered a month&rsquo;s worth.</span></p>
<p>A few days later the <a href="https://nutrapod.co/products/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></span></a> arrived. I examined the box they came in to read all the ingredients. It said this coffee contained B vitamins, MCT Oil, Lions Mane, and Tumeric.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting&rdquo; I thought to myself as I made myself a cup</span></p>
<p>Before I was even halfway done with that cup I realized that I had found something special.</span></p>
<p>My mind was incredibly clear and I was incredibly focused.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">I had one cup in the morning every day for the next month and I felt an amazing difference in the way I felt.</span></strong></p>
<p>Tommy even started asking me to give him rides again and I was able to do so without getting lost.</span></p>
<p>Life was amazing. I knew Elise was looking down, smiling at the both of us.</span></p>
<p>I<strong>t&rsquo;s been 6 months</strong> since I started using <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://nutrapod.co/products/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff; text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></a></span> and I can&rsquo;t believe that I ever lived without it!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://nutrapod.co/products/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></span></a> is a must use for <strong>anyone who has ever dealt with brain fog or has trouble waking up</strong>. I also recommend <a href="https://nutrapod.co/products/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></span></a> to everyone and anyone who wants to improve their brain!</span></p>
