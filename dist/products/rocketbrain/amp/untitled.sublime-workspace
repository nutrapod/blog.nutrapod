As I grew older I thought that I would become less active but that was not the case. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">When I was 30 years old I was still working two jobs but this time it was out of choice. I was a construction foreman and managed a construction crew of 30. I spent the rest of my time helping my wife run her food blog. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I never thought I would take part in operating a food blog, but I got to say she has made some real serious money off the thing! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">And on top of that, it was another excuse to spend time with my wife while still keeping busy like I always had </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>Life was good</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Until, one day at the construction site I noticed a very random sharp pain in a few of my fingers. This pain happened every now and then in both of my hands at random times. This time was different though. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>The pain was a lot sharper and it didn&rsquo;t go away.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I ignored it for a couple of days until my fingers were literally misshapen and swollen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>My wife demanded that we go to the hospital and get them looked at immediately.</strong> At that hospital in that same day I was diagnosed with what the doctor called RA, which was short for Rheumatoid Arthritis </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">What I didn&rsquo;t know was how that was going to change my life forever. I thought that this RA was going to be treated the same way doctors treat everything. Give me some pills and let them work their magic. <strong>But I was so wrong. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I proceeded on with my busy life normally for a while but the arthritis continued to bother me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">The pain was so bad but I did my best to ignore it. There eventually became no way I could even help my wife with her business anymore which was killing me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">On top of that people were starting to ask me about my swollen and misshapen fingers at work. It honestly felt like the pain grew worse as time went on. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I remember it had probably been a year since I had first been diagnosed when I realized, <strong>&ldquo;wow, this is never going to go away&rdquo;. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">That&rsquo;s when I had the idea to figure out a way to live with rheumatoid arthritis. I started doing research on ways to ease the pain and told myself I would try them all until I found something. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I tried every natural remedy out there, I tried several different medications, I even had fusion surgeries to have pain relieved. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>I couldn&rsquo;t find anything that had a lasting effect and everything I tried had cost a fortune.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I was just about ready to give up and accept that I may have to deal with this for the rest of my life <strong>until I stumbled across something online. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I was shopping for household items online when I saw a very interesting flavor of coffee. It was labeled <a href=\"https://nutrapod.co/products/pods-2\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nutrapod Golden Milk</span></span></a> blend. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">What was interesting about this coffee was the ingredients. it was filled with nutrients that are said to provide numerous benefits! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">The coffee included Coffee, coconut milk, turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, honey, Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, Lucuma, Potassium, maca root powder </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"> I scanned through the list of benefits, and once I saw that &ldquo;reduces inflammation&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;arthritis support&rdquo; I ordered it immediately. I knew that there was a small chance of this working so I did not get my hopes up. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">A few days later I was getting ready for work early in the morning when I looked down at my hands, they were not swollen at all but I could feel the pain start to creep. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I opened the door to head to work and looked down and saw a package for me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I completely forgot that I had ordered the <strong>Nutrapod golden blend coffee.</strong> I picked up the box and retreated back inside to make a cup. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I made one cup and drank it on the way to work and I must say that it was truly delicious. <strong>Even if the stuff didn&rsquo;t end up working, I was definitely going to keep ordering more. </strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I drank a cup every morning and sometimes some during the day when I was feeling a little drowsy and I gotta say I felt somewhat back to the way things used to be. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Every now and then it hurt a little but it was looking like the coffee had helped my symptoms tremendously. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">The doctor told me different peoples bodies respond to different treatments but never did I think coffee would be the answer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">I ordered more immediately and have been drinking <a href=\"https://nutrapod.co/products/pods-2\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Nutrapod Golden Milk</span></span></a> since. If you or you know someone who has had a hard time finding a solution, I highly recommend giving Nutrapod Golden blend a try! </span></p>",
