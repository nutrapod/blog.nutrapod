I’m not sure why, but I always was able to learn things faster than others my age.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">I spent my entire career as a professor at The University of Columbia and I loved every single part of it.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I felt like I was doing exactly what I was called to do. The only thing I loved more than learning was teaching, and who better to teach than the young adults who are about to enter the so called “real world”.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I lived about 30 minutes away from our campus with my wife Elise. I honestly can say that I had the life I had always dreamed of. Well… almost</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Unfortunately, my wife and I never had a child. We tried and tried but she never was able to get pregnant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Although this was sad at the time for us two we stayed hopeful that we would eventually get our miracle baby.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Many years went by with no luck. We even looked at adopting a child but we never seemed to be able to find the right one.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">We began to accept and come to terms with the fact that maybe our family was fine the way it is. With just us two.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">My wife and I were both in our mid 40s and we decided that maybe it was time to stop trying.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Although we were sad for a while, we eventually came to terms with it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Then one day as I walked into our home I found my wife sitting on the couch. She looked so incredibly happy but she had tears coming from her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I rushed to the couch to comfort her and see what the problem was.<strong> That’s when she let out a massive smile and gave me a huge hug.</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I was still confused but I gave her a hug back. As she was crying in my arms, I looked at our coffee table and saw what appeared to be a used pregnancy test in a zip lock baggie.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">I looked a little closer and saw a positive result.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">So many emotions were coming out of me at the same time. It was a feeling I will never be able to put into words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">We finally were blessed with our miracle baby.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">We had saved money our entire adult lives anticipating this moment and it finally came.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">On top of that, I was planning on retiring soon. So I was going to have unlimited time to raise our child.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">9 months later I welcomed our handsome son into the world and said goodbye to my wife forever.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Unfortunately, she passed away giving birth to our son. So I solely held the responsibility to raise our miracle baby. I made a promise to my late wife and a promise to myself that I would do everything in my power to ensure this child would live a great life.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">Tommy coming into the world was such a blessing.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.shgcdn.com/30ae150c-018c-4c18-a1e6-e0eec62e934f/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/" alt=""></span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">When he was younger he grew up just like any other kid.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">But I noticed the older he grew, the more distant he became.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I thought for a second it was normal thing that teenage boys go through. But then I asked him about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Hey champ, can I talk to you for a second” I said</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I asked him why he never wanted a ride from me anymore. He always was getting rides from his friends parents.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“I can drop you and your friends off to practice if you need Tommy Boy” I would say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">He almost always declined.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">And then one day he finally took me up on it. <strong>He asked if I could take him and a couple of his friends to the movies.</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Yes I quickly said!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">We hopped in my car and hit the road to go get both of his friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Unfortunately, what should have been a 30 minute drive turned into over an hour trip.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I swear I was following the directions, but the stupid GPS kept on rerouting itself. The kids were completely silent and Tommy was giving me a glare.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I felt bad for getting my son to the movies late but it was an honest mistake. I’m just not the best at using technology.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I knew that I was expected to be back at the movies to pick him up in just an hour, so I sat down in the living room to watch some tv and kill some time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Next thing I know, I’m being woken up by Tommy. I must had fell asleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“How did you get home son”? I said in a concerning tone</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“We waited for an hour dad.. Michaels dad ended up picking us up” He replied with a disappointed tone as he walked down the hallway to his room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">That night, I had to do some serious thinking. It was clear that I was getting older and I felt bad because I couldn’t be the father that I wanted to be for Tommy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Growing up as a single child, without a mother and an older father can’t be easy. <strong>I felt like he was getting robbed of a normal childhood in every way. I had to do something about it.</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I spent that night thinking back to the old days when my mind was sharp as a tack. That was a part of me that my child never got to meet. I knew there had to be something that I could do.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">I got on our computer and started doing research on how to keep a sharp brain.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.shgcdn.com/965c743e-4f46-43d1-9a95-213897a40f7d/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/" alt=""></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The only things I found were things that I already knew. <strong>Exercise, sleep and diet.</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">But there had to be something else. There had to be some sort of way to achieve greater mental clarity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">After a couple more hours of research I finally stumbled upon something that looked interesting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">They were called <a href="https://nutrapod.co/pages/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></span></a>. These pods were a coffee alternative that claim to be much better for you. hey</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">The reviews said they were like <strong>vitamins for your brain</strong> and their website promised to help you achieve <strong>higher levels of mental clarity</strong>.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I also read about the ingredients online and was really impressed. Theres MCT Oil, Turmeric, Lion's Mane, and B-Vitamins all packed in just one blend (Rocket Brain).</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.shgcdn.com/bbd45021-15b2-4bf4-8349-c1563cfde3af/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/" alt=""></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Apparently <strong>MCT Oil</strong> has been shown to improve short term cognition and reduce appetite.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">And <strong>Turmeric</strong> increases memory functions and boosts something called "Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor" (BDNF), so that your brain continues to create new brain cells—something which naturally stops at 25 without the help of BDNF.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Lion’s Mane</strong> has been shown to reduce symptoms of memory loss, prevent neuronal damage accumulated during Alzheimer’s, decrease cognitive impairment in adults, and reduce inflammation in the brain.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">And last but not least <strong>B Vitamins</strong> give the brain and body tan extra energy boost.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Desperate for something, I put in my credit card information and ordered a month’s worth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">A few days later the <a href="https://nutrapod.co/pages/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></span></a> arrived. I examined the box they came in to read all the ingredients. It said this coffee contained B vitamins, MCT Oil, Lions Mane, and Tumeric.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">“Interesting” I thought to myself as I made myself a cup</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Before I was even halfway done with that cup I realized that I had found something special.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">My mind was incredibly clear and I was incredibly focused.</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">I had one cup in the morning every day for the next month and I felt an amazing difference in the way I felt.</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Tommy even started asking me to give him rides again and I was able to do so without getting lost.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">Life was amazing. I knew Elise was looking down, smiling at the both of us.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;">I<strong>t’s been 6 months</strong> since I started using <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://nutrapod.co/pages/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff; text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></a></span> and I can’t believe that I ever lived without it!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><a href="https://nutrapod.co/pages/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></span></a> is a must use for <strong>anyone who has ever dealt with brain fog or has trouble waking up</strong>.
