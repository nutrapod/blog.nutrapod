<span style="float:left;color:#000000;font-size:60px;line-height:35px;padding-top:3px; padding-right:5px;font-family: Times, serif, Georgia;">M</span>
<p id="letter">My life has been dominated by pain. I can remember few moments where I have been truly free from the pain of RA. </p>
<p>I grew up in Los Angeles, California where I excelled in school. I had always dreamed of being the CEO of a big company one day or doing something important for the world. </p>
<p>I graduated at the top of my high school class and went to college in Denmark where I studied computer engineering. I graduated early with honors and came back to California to start hunting for jobs. </p>
<p>I remember sitting in my parents living room applying for jobs, <strong>when one day my wrist became swollen. </strong></p>
<p>My grandma and my mother both had rheumatoid arthritis so I knew what this could be a sign of but I did not want to believe it </p>
<p>I ignored it and the swelling eventually went away. </p>
<p>The next day the swelling came back and the next day after that as well. Eventually I figured that I better head into the hospital and get this checked out. </p>
<p>I left the hospital that day newly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I walked out of that hospital not knowing I was walking into a new world. </p>
<p><strong>A world that was ruled by pain.</strong> </p>
<p>I went on to accept a job working as a computer engineer shortly after my diagnosis. </p>
<p>I worked this job for a few years but then my arthritis worsened. It got to the point where I had to resign so I could focus on managing my RA. </p>
<p>I stayed out of the work force for a year while I tried to find ways to manage the pain. </p>
<p>I tried everything from natural remedies to medications prescribed by a doctor. My doctor had told me that people respond differently to different treatments and I had to find the one that worked the best for me. </p>
<p>After about a year of trying many different things to get the pain to ease up I landed on one medication and paired that with routine fusion surgeries. </p>
<p><strong>Doing this definitely helped the physical pain.</strong> </p>
<p>I was able to re-land my dream job of computer engineer. After about two years the company that I worked for offered to send me back to college all expenses paid for. </p>
<p>I was absolutely thrilled because I knew that this was a huge opportunity. </p>
<p>Going to college for another year to get a master&rsquo;s degree would definitely allow me to qualify for even more prestigious jobs in the future. </p>
<p>I knew I had to accept. </p>
<p>The next year I started the master&rsquo;s program at The University of Southern California. </p>
<p>I left USC one year later with a master&rsquo;s degree and a new girlfriend who eventually became my wife. </p>
<p>I returned to work full time and got a promotion after receiving my masters degree. </p>
<p>Life sure was looking much better than it did just a couple of years ago. <strong>That is until I started having this terrible pain in my right knee.</strong> It felt like my knew was broken and it was incredibly swollen. </p>
<p><strong>What used to work to help me deal with the pain was no longer working</strong>. I knew I had to figure something out fast. </p>
<p>I just did all that work to get my master&rsquo;s degree, met the love of my life and got a promotion at work. I could not let this come and tear my life apart again. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the pain moved around my body much faster than last time. It started with my knee, and soon all my joints started to hurt. </p>
<p>It was a pretty swift decline over the course of 1 year. </p>
<p>Eventually, I found myself in a similar situation from a few years ago. </p>
<p>My life was being dominated by pain. </p>
<p>RA was not only diminishing my ability to work, but it also seemed like it was all my wife and I talked about which was effecting our relationship. </p>
<p>After having to leave the job I loved so much, I started to sink into a deep state of depression. </p>
<p><strong>My wife and I decided that it was a good idea for me to check into something called the Robinson Clinics Pain Rehabilitation Clinic. </strong></p>
<p>I consider this decision to be absolutely life changing and it may not be because of the reasons you think. </p>
<p>In the rehabilitation center, I learned many different tactics to deal with the pain that I was facing. </p>
<p> I felt like I finally was able to accept the fact that this was my life and I became okay with it. </p>
<p>A few days before I was about to leave, I started self-evaluating myself. I realized that I had come such a long way mentally but unfortunately I could not say the same physically. </p>
<p>On the morning I was checking out, I met someone who was drinking the best smelling stuff I had ever smelled. </p>
<p><strong>It smelled like cinnamon with a mix of coffee and a little citrus.</strong> I knew that I had to find out what this mystery drink was before I left this place. </p>
<p>I asked the man what he was drinking and his reply is what made the entire experience life changing. </p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://nutrapod.co/products/pods-2"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Golden Milk blend</a>&rdquo; he replied </p>
<p>&ldquo;huhh? Whats that?&rdquo; I asked </p>
<p>He went on to tell me how it was like coffee but it was healthy for you. He continued to ramble on and on about all the benefits that they helped him with and it quickly became clear to me that he was a bit of a head case. </p>
<p>Eventually I interrupted him because my wife had arrived to take me home. </p>
<p>When I got home that day, I went straight to the computer to do order some of those nutra pods before I forgot. I ordered about a month&rsquo;s worth and could not wait for them to arrive. </p>
<p>I was getting fusion surgeries and I was taking some medication which made my RA somewhat manageable. Due to this, and my much improved mental state, I decided I would try and get back into the work force. </p>
<p>I started waking up every morning, <strong>having a cup of coffee and applying for opportunities in my field. </strong></p>
<p>After about a week went by I noticed something. I hadn&rsquo;t felt any pain at all! I figured the fusion surgeries and medication were working extremely well. </p>
<p>About a month went by and I ran out of more of that delicious coffee! I loved the taste so much, that it was a no brainer to make this my go to morning drink. </p>
<p><strong>I ordered more and waited for the new box to arrive.</strong> Something interesting happened in between this waiting period however. I started feeling some slight pain again. </p>
<p>I started thinking back to that crazy old man who told me about the coffee and all of the benefits that it helped him with. I can&rsquo;t remember exactly what he said so I did some research on the ingredients in this coffee. </p>
<p><strong>Turmeric</strong> - modern medicine has recognized turmeric for many beneficial properties for the body. It performs an important purifying function, supporting our body in the process of expelling toxins. Turmeric is also a powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and natural antibacterial, very useful in preventing and alleviating the symptoms of the flu. It is very valuable for the heart and for gastric functions, stimulates brain cells by improving memory skills, and is an excellent ally of metabolism. </p>
<p><strong>Cinnamon</strong> - The highest class of spice that is responsible for so many benefits. Its antibacterial properties are great for anyone bothering with acne while its antioxidants protect your skin against damage caused by free radicals. This will leave your skin smoother and healthier. </p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong> - chemical compounds in ginger help your body ward off germs. They&rsquo;re especially good at halting growth of bacteria like E.coli and shigella, and they may also keep viruses like RSV at bay </p>
<p><strong>Maca Root Powder</strong> - It packs high levels of iron and iodine to promote healthy cells and to help keep your metabolism on track. Its big doses of potassium help digestion and make muscles happy. Maca is also rich in calcium, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it clicked to me. </p>
<p>Maybe I had finally found the combination of treatments that work for me. Fusions coupled with this magical coffee and some medications. </p>
<p><strong>I continued taking these three and stopped having serious pain from my RA all together.</strong> </p>
<p>RA is something that seriously negatively effected my life and even the lifes of those around me. </p>
<p><strong>I want my story to give hope to those struggling with RA!</strong> Your unique combination of treatments is out there and you should never stop searching to find a solution! </p>
<p>It worked so well for me I would recommend anyone who is struggling finding a solution to give this stuff a try! </p>

<p>Personal information we collect </p>
<p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”. </p>


<p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies: </p>
<p>- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. </p>

<p>We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to: </p>
<p>- Communicate with you; </p>
<p>- Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and </p>
