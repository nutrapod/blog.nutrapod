<p id="letter">hen I was a young boy, I can remember wowing all of my friends with random facts that I had memorized. I&rsquo;m not sure why, but I always was able to learn things faster than others my age.</p>
  
<p><strong>I spent my entire career as a professor at The University of Columbia and I loved every single part of it.</span></strong></p>
<p>I felt like I was doing exactly what I was called to do. The only thing I loved more than learning was teaching, and who better to teach than the young adults who are about to enter the so called &ldquo;real world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I lived about 30 minutes away from our campus with my wife Elise. I honestly can say that I had the life I had always dreamed of. Well&hellip; almost</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my wife and I never had a child. We tried and tried but she never was able to get pregnant.</p>
<p>Although this was sad at the time for us two we stayed hopeful that we would eventually get our miracle baby.</p>
<p>Many years went by with no luck. We even looked at adopting a child but we never seemed to be able to find the right one.</p>
<p>We began to accept and come to terms with the fact that maybe our family was fine the way it is. With just us two.</p>
<p><strong>My wife and I were both in our mid 40s and we decided that maybe it was time to stop trying.</span></strong></p>
<p>Although we were sad for a while, we eventually came to terms with it.</p>
<p>Then one day as I walked into our home I found my wife sitting on the couch. She looked so incredibly happy but she had tears coming from her eyes.</p>
<p>I rushed to the couch to comfort her and see what the problem was.<strong> That&rsquo;s when she let out a massive smile and gave me a huge hug.</strong></p>
<p>I was still confused but I gave her a hug back. As she was crying in my arms, I looked at our coffee table and saw what appeared to be a used pregnancy test in a zip lock baggie.</p>
<p><strong>I looked a little closer and saw a positive result.</span></strong></p>
<p>So many emotions were coming out of me at the same time. It was a feeling I will never be able to put into words.</p>
<p>We finally were blessed with our miracle baby.</p>
<p>We had saved money our entire adult lives anticipating this moment and it finally came.</p>
<p>On top of that, I was planning on retiring soon. So I was going to have unlimited time to raise our child.</p>
<p>9 months later I welcomed our handsome son into the world and said goodbye to my wife forever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she passed away giving birth to our son. So I solely held the responsibility to raise our miracle baby. I made a promise to my late wife and a promise to myself that I would do everything in my power to ensure this child would live a great life.</p>
<p><strong>Tommy coming into the world was such a blessing.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.shgcdn.com/30ae150c-018c-4c18-a1e6-e0eec62e934f/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/" alt="" /></span></strong></p>
<p>When he was younger he grew up just like any other kid.</p>
<p>But I noticed the older he grew, the more distant he became.</p>
<p>I thought for a second it was normal thing that teenage boys go through. But then I asked him about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey champ, can I talk to you for a second&rdquo; I said</p>
<p>I asked him why he never wanted a ride from me anymore. He always was getting rides from his friends parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can drop you and your friends off to practice if you need Tommy Boy&rdquo; I would say.</p>
<p>He almost always declined.</p>
<p>And then one day he finally took me up on it. <strong>He asked if I could take him and a couple of his friends to the movies.</strong></p>
<p>Yes I quickly said!</p>
<p>We hopped in my car and hit the road to go get both of his friends.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what should have been a 30 minute drive turned into over an hour trip.</p>
<p>I swear I was following the directions, but the stupid GPS kept on rerouting itself. The kids were completely silent and Tommy was giving me a glare.</p>
<p>I felt bad for getting my son to the movies late but it was an honest mistake. I&rsquo;m just not the best at using technology.</p>
<p>I knew that I was expected to be back at the movies to pick him up in just an hour, so I sat down in the living room to watch some tv and kill some time.</p>
<p>Next thing I know, I&rsquo;m being woken up by Tommy. I must had fell asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get home son&rdquo;? I said in a concerning tone</p>
<p>&ldquo;We waited for an hour dad.. Michaels dad ended up picking us up&rdquo; He replied with a disappointed tone as he walked down the hallway to his room.</p>
<p>That night, I had to do some serious thinking. It was clear that I was getting older and I felt bad because I couldn&rsquo;t be the father that I wanted to be for Tommy.</p>
<p>Growing up as a single child, without a mother and an older father can&rsquo;t be easy. <strong>I felt like he was getting robbed of a normal childhood in every way. I had to do something about it.</strong></p>
<p>I spent that night thinking back to the old days when my mind was sharp as a tack. That was a part of me that my child never got to meet. I knew there had to be something that I could do.</p>
<p><strong>I got on our computer and started doing research on how to keep a sharp brain.</span></strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.shgcdn.com/965c743e-4f46-43d1-9a95-213897a40f7d/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/" alt="" /></p>
<p>The only things I found were things that I already knew. <strong>Exercise, sleep and diet.</strong></p>
<p>But there had to be something else. There had to be some sort of way to achieve greater mental clarity.</p>
<p>After a couple more hours of research I finally stumbled upon something that looked interesting.</p>
<p>They were called <a href="https://nutrapod.co/products/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></span></a>. These pods were a coffee alternative that claim to be much better for you. hey</p>
<p>The reviews said they were like <strong>vitamins for your brain</strong> and their website promised to help you achieve <strong>higher levels of mental clarity</strong>.</p>
<p>I also read about the ingredients online and was really impressed. Theres MCT Oil, Turmeric, Lion's Mane, and B-Vitamins&nbsp; all packed in just one blend (Rocket Brain).</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.shgcdn.com/bbd45021-15b2-4bf4-8349-c1563cfde3af/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/" alt="" /></p>
<p>Apparently <strong>MCT Oil</strong> has been shown to improve short term cognition and reduce appetite.</p>
<p>And <strong>Turmeric</strong> increases memory functions and boosts&nbsp; something called "Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor" (BDNF), so that your brain continues to create new brain cells&mdash;something which naturally stops at 25 without the help of BDNF.</p>
<p><strong>Lion&rsquo;s Mane</strong> has been shown to reduce symptoms of memory loss, prevent neuronal damage accumulated during Alzheimer&rsquo;s, decrease cognitive impairment in adults, and reduce inflammation in the brain.</p>
<p>And last but not least <strong>B Vitamins</strong> give the brain and body tan extra energy boost.</p>
<p>Desperate for something, I put in my credit card information and ordered a month&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>A few days later the <a href="https://nutrapod.co/products/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></span></a> arrived. I examined the box they came in to read all the ingredients. It said this coffee contained B vitamins, MCT Oil, Lions Mane, and Tumeric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting&rdquo; I thought to myself as I made myself a cup</p>
<p>Before I was even halfway done with that cup I realized that I had found something special.</p>
<p>My mind was incredibly clear and I was incredibly focused.</p>
<p><strong>I had one cup in the morning every day for the next month and I felt an amazing difference in the way I felt.</span></strong></p>
<p>Tommy even started asking me to give him rides again and I was able to do so without getting lost.</p>
<p>Life was amazing. I knew Elise was looking down, smiling at the both of us.</p>
<p>I<strong>t&rsquo;s been 6 months</strong> since I started using <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://nutrapod.co/products/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff; text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></a></span> and I can&rsquo;t believe that I ever lived without it!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://nutrapod.co/products/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></span></a> is a must use for <strong>anyone who has ever dealt with brain fog or has trouble waking up</strong>. I also recommend <a href="https://nutrapod.co/products/coffee-beans"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NutraPod RocketBrain Pods</span></span></a> to everyone and anyone who wants to improve their brain!</span></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from www.blog.NutraPod.co (the “Site”). </p>


<p>Personal information we collect </p>
<p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”. </p>


<p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies: </p>
<p>- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. </p>
<p>- “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. </p>
<p>- “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site. </p>


<p>Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order Information”. </p>


<p>When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information. </p>


<p>How do we use your personal information? </p>
<p>We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to: </p>
<p>- Communicate with you; </p>
<p>- Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and </p>
<p>- When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services. </p>


<p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns). </p>


<p>Sharing you personal Information </p>
<p>We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.

You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. </p>


<p>Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights. </p>


<p>Behavioural advertising </p>
<p>As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications we believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work. </p>
